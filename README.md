# NBA-Prediction-Model
Welcome to my NBA Prediction Model!

This model is a proof of concept and a passion project of mine.  This model will evolve dramatically over time.  

The model in its current form is not user friendly to run.  I am currently building out code to make running this model easier to run.  

2022-2023 NBA Regular Season Results:
Before leveraging machine learning models the accuracy rate was ~59.50%.  
After utilizing machine learning models, the accuracy rate reached ~64.47% using logistic regression.
