# NBA-Prediction-Model
Welcome to my NBA Prediction Model!

This model is a proof of concept and a passion project of mine.  

The model in its current form is not user friendly to run. But I am creating the update_data.py file to be the 'go-to' file to run every part of the model.  From data collection/cleaning to actually calculating results, that file will be the only file a user will need to run. 

2022-2023 NBA Regular Season Results:

As a simple statistical model and  the accuracy rate was ~59.50%.  
After utilizing machine learning models such as random forest and logistic regression, the accuracy rate reached ~64.47%.
